                    This Ensaladang Pako is very simple. Usually prepared with fresh onions and tomatoes that add flavors to the rather mild taste of the vegetable fern. It is mostly added for its crispy texture that is quite refreshing.<br>

                    But vegetable fern is not without health benefits. It is said to be rich in minerals such as potassium and zinc. And also, high in antioxidant and an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and some vitamin B complex.</p>

                    Dadulal is often taken and used in cooking as a vegetable and is referred to as the Philippine native asparagus. It is harvested and cooked into a variety of vegetable dishes, much like that of Ilocano aba.
                    In Negros and Panay islands where it is called takway, it is often boiled and then seasoned with suka (vinegar) and asin (salt) or included in making Ilonggo laswa (boiled assorted vegetables).</p>
